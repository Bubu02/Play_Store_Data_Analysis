## Scatter plot for Revenue and Number of Installs âœ¨

This scatter plot shows the relationship between the number of installs (x-axis) and revenue in USD (y-axis) for paid apps across multiple categories. The data points are color-coded by app category, with 20 different categories represented including Business, Communication, Dating, Education, and others.
The blue trendline indicates a strong positive correlation between the number of installs and revenue - as installs increase, revenue generally increases as well. The plot shows data points ranging from 0-16 installs and $0-18 in revenue.

### Some notable observations:
- Business apps (light green) appear to have some of the highest revenue points
- Communication apps (orange) show strong performance in the higher install ranges
- The data forms a relatively tight band along the trendline, suggesting a consistent relationship
- There's more data density in the middle range (6-14 installs), indicating this might be the typical performance range for paid apps
